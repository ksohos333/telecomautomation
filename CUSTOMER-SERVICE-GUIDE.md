# Customer Service Automation Guide

This system can help automate customer service tasks across multiple channels. Here's how to use it for different scenarios:

## Email Support Automation

To test the email support functionality:

1. Run the email server:
   ```
   .\run-email-server.bat
   ```

2. Open the email test page:
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/email-test.html
   ```

3. Fill out the form with a test support request and submit it.

The system will:
- Process the email
- Classify the intent
- Generate a response using AI
- Send an automated reply

## Puppeteer Automation (Visual Support)

To test the visual support with screenshots:

1. Run the puppeteer test:
   ```
   .\open-puppeteer-test.bat
   ```

2. Open the puppeteer test page:
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/puppeteer-test.html
   ```

3. Select a scenario (like "VPN Connection Issue" or "Zoom Setup")

The system will:
- Run automated browser actions
- Take screenshots at each step
- Show you the resolution process visually

## Support Ticket System

To test the support ticket system:

1. Run the support test:
   ```
   .\open-support-test.bat
   ```

2. Open the support test page:
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/support-test.html
   ```

3. Submit a test support ticket

The system will:
- Create a ticket
- Process it using AI
- Provide a response based on the issue type

## Integration with Messaging Platforms

To integrate with WhatsApp, Telegram, or Viber, you would need to:

1. Set up webhook endpoints (already available in the code)
2. Configure your messaging platform to send messages to these webhooks
3. The system will process incoming messages similar to emails

For WhatsApp Business API integration:
- Use the webhook routes in `src/routes/webhookRoutes.js`
- Configure your WhatsApp Business account to point to your server

For Telegram:
- Create a bot using BotFather
- Set the webhook URL to your server
- Messages will be processed by the webhook handler

## Voice Support

For voice support:
- The system can generate text responses that can be converted to speech
- You would need to integrate with a text-to-speech service like Google's Text-to-Speech API

## Extending the System

To add more capabilities:
- Add new scenarios in `src/utils/puppeteerScripts.js`
- Add new response templates in the support controller
- Configure additional messaging channels in the webhook routes

## Monitoring and Logs

To monitor the system:
- Check the logs directory for detailed logs
- Use the metrics endpoint to see performance statistics
- Review ticket history in the database or JSON files

This system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing you to automate customer service across multiple channels with visual guidance, text responses, and potentially voice support.
