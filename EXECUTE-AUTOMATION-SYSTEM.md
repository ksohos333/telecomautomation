# Execute Customer Service Automation System

## Step 1: Launch All Components
Run this command to start all servers:
```bash
.\run-all-services.bat
```

## Step 2: Verify Services
Ensure these URLs are accessible:
- Main test page: http://localhost:3007/test-page.html
- Email test: http://localhost:3001/email-test.html
- Support tickets: http://localhost:3001/support-test.html
- Puppeteer visual support: http://localhost:3001/puppeteer-test.html

## Step 3: Test Error Handling
- Click "Test 404 Error" and "Test 500 Error" buttons
- Verify proper JSON responses with correct status codes
- If you see "Unexpected response" occasionally, this is a known issue with the validation but doesn't affect functionality

## Step 4: Test Email Support
- Go to http://localhost:3001/email-test.html
- Submit a support request with your email
- The system will process and respond automatically

## Step 5: Test Visual Support
- Go to http://localhost:3001/puppeteer-test.html
- Select a scenario (e.g., "VPN Connection Issue")
- Review the automated steps and screenshots

## Step 6: Test Support Tickets
- Go to http://localhost:3001/support-test.html
- Create a test ticket
- Check the response generated by the AI

## Step 7: Verify Logs
Review logs to confirm proper processing:
```bash
dir logs
```

## Step 8: Integration Testing
For integration with messaging platforms:
- Use the webhook routes in src/routes/webhookRoutes.js
- Test incoming message processing

## Note on Errors
If error messages appear about "body stream already read", these don't affect functionality and have been addressed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Server Connection Issues**
   - Ensure all servers are running (check for 3 command windows)
   - Verify ports 3001 and 3007 are not in use by other applications

2. **Error Handling Test Issues**
   - Try refreshing the page before testing
   - Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

3. **Email Processing Issues**
   - Verify the email server is running
   - Check logs for any connection errors

4. **Puppeteer Visual Support Issues**
   - Ensure Puppeteer is properly installed
   - Check screenshots directory exists and is writable

5. **Support Ticket Issues**
   - Verify the local database files exist
   - Check permissions on data directory

## Example Scenarios

### Email Support Scenario
1. Submit an email with subject: "Can't access my Notion templates"
2. Body: "I'm trying to duplicate a template but it's not working. I clicked duplicate but nothing happens."
3. The system should classify this as a template issue and provide relevant troubleshooting steps

### Visual Support Scenario
1. Select "VPN Connection Issue" scenario
2. The system will show screenshots of:
   - VPN login page
   - Filled form
   - Error message
   - Troubleshooting steps
   - Successful connection

### Support Ticket Scenario
1. Create a ticket about: "How do I change language in Notion?"
2. The system should identify this as a multi-language issue
3. Response should include steps to access language settings

This comprehensive workflow allows you to test all components of the customer service automation system and verify that they're working correctly together.
