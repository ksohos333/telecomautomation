This document provides a quick reference for setting up and working with GitHub for this project.

## Files Included

- `github-setup-instructions.md`: Detailed instructions for setting up GitHub

## Quick Start

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
   - Create a new repository named "telecom-auto" (or your preferred name)
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license

2. **Connect Your Local Repository**
   - Windows: Run `connect-to-github.bat`
   - macOS/Linux: Run `bash connect-to-github.sh`
   - Enter your GitHub username and repository name when prompted

3. **Verify Connection**
   - Windows: Run `check-github-connection.bat`
   - macOS/Linux: Run `bash check-github-connection.sh`

4. **Work with Codex**
   - Use GitHub Codespaces (recommended)
   - Use GitHub.dev (for quick edits)
   - Clone locally and use with your preferred editor

## Using Codex with GitHub

GitHub Codespaces provides the best integration with Codex:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Code" > "Codespaces" > "Create codespace on main"
3. Use Codex within the browser-based VS Code environment

This gives you:
- Full development environment in the cloud
- All dependencies pre-installed
- Seamless GitHub integration
- Full Codex capabilities with repository context

## Common Commands

```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push

# Pull latest changes
git pull
```
