# Simple Testing Instructions

Follow these steps to test the architectural fixes:

## 1. Start the Server

Run the following command in PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```
.\start-server.bat
```

## 2. Access the Test Page

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3007/test-page.html
```

## 3. Test Error Handling

On the test page, you can:

- Click the "Test 404 Error" button to verify proper 404 error handling
- Click the "Test 500 Error" button to verify proper 500 error handling

## 4. Verify the Fixes

The test page will show you if the error handling is working correctly. You should see:

- JSON error responses instead of HTML error pages
- Proper status codes (404 for not found, 500 for server errors)

## 5. Check the Logs

After running the tests, check the logs directory:

```
dir logs
```

You should see properly formatted log files with timestamps and error details.

## 6. Shutdown Test

Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the server is running to test graceful shutdown. You should see:

- "Shutting down static express server..." message
- Clean termination of the process

That's it! These simple tests verify that the architectural fixes are working correctly.
