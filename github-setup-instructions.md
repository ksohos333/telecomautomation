# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., "telecom-auto")
4. Add a description (optional): "An AI-powered automation system for customer support and tech support roles"
5. Choose visibility (Public or Private)
6. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since you're pushing an existing repository)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository.

### For Windows Users

You can use the provided `connect-to-github.bat` script:

1. Double-click the `connect-to-github.bat` file
2. Enter your GitHub username when prompted
3. Enter your repository name (or press Enter to use the default "telecom-auto")
4. The script will connect your local repository to GitHub and push your code

### For macOS/Linux Users

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Replace with your GitHub username
USERNAME="your-username"
# Replace with your repository name (or leave as telecom-auto)
REPO="telecom-auto"

git remote add origin https://github.com/$USERNAME/$REPO.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and modify `telecom-auto` if you chose a different repository name.

## Step 3: Verify the Repository

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files and commit history

## Step 4: Making Changes on Codex from GitHub

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended for Codex Integration)

GitHub Codespaces provides a full development environment in the cloud that works seamlessly with Codex:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the "Code" button
3. Select the "Codespaces" tab
4. Click "Create codespace on main"
5. This will open a browser-based VS Code environment with your repository
6. Codex can be used directly within this environment for AI-assisted coding

Benefits for Codex users:
- Full development environment with all dependencies
- Seamless GitHub integration
- No need to set up local environment
- Codex can access all repository files and context

### Option 2: GitHub.dev

For quick edits with Codex assistance:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Press the period key (`.`) on your keyboard
3. This will open a lightweight VS Code environment in your browser
4. Codex can assist with coding in this environment

### Option 3: Clone in Local Environment

If you prefer working locally with Codex:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/telecom-auto.git
cd telecom-auto
npm install
```

Then open the project in your preferred editor that supports Codex integration.

## Step 5: Working with the Repository

After making changes in any of these environments:

1. Stage your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```

3. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

## Important Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Since your .env file is excluded by .gitignore, you'll need to set up environment variables in any new environment.

2. **Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in any new environment to install dependencies.

3. **Database Setup**: Follow the README instructions to set up Pinecone and MongoDB in any new environment.
